The bépo keyboard addict dotfiles repository
============================================

Various linux configuration files — lot of them using bépo layout and/or 
vim-styles shortcuts.

This is a keyboard oriented configuration based on i3 (currently testing 
sway/wayland).

Most of the work on bépo configuration is made in my 
[vim-bepoptimist](https://github.com/sheoak/vim-bepoptimist) plugin).
I'm still experiencing a lot on it, it might be unstable. Any participation is 
welcome if you're a bépo enthousiast.
