! Exchange left Alt and left Win!
! This is to be able to use Alt key as i3 modifier without breaking other
! applications shortcuts. Then in i3 I configure Mod4 (Super_L) as modifier
! but it is in fact Alt_L
clear mod1
clear mod4
keycode 133 = Alt_L Meta_L
keycode 64  = Super_L
add mod1 = Alt_L Meta_L
add mod4 = Super_L
